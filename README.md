# readme-generator

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- Every open source project on GitHub requires a good wality professional README explaining what the application is for, how to use the app, how to install it and also allow other developers to make contributions to the project for its success.
- This project was to automate the generation of a README file by using a command-line application.
- This allows the developer to devote more time to working on the project and also to ensure that all the required details of the application is made available to the users through a concise README in much less time.
- During this implementation, I was able to apply my knowledge on node.js, initialization and installation of npm dependencies, read-write files, modularization, Basic and Advanced inquirer.

## Installation

Follow these instructions to create your project and deploy it to GitHub Pages:

1. Create a new repository on your GitHub account and clone it to your computer.

2. When you're ready to deploy, use the git add, git commit, and git push commands to save and push your code to your GitHub repository.

3. Navigate to your GitHub repository in the browser and then select the Settings tab on the right side of the page.

4. On the Settings page, select Pages on the left side of the page. On the GitHub Pages screen, choose main in the dropdown under Branch. Click the Save button.

5. Navigate to <your-github-username.github.io/your-repository-name> and you will find that your new webpage has gone live! For example, if your GitHub username is "lernantino" and the project is "css-demo-site", then your URL would be <lernantino.github.io/css-demo-site>.
